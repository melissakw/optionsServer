# Options Trading Analytics Demo (Server Application)

This Node.js application is part of the Options Trading Analytics Demo project.


## About

There are two parts to this app:

- This repo hosts the server application only
- You can find the client application [here](https://github.com/melissakw/optionChain)

The client application allows you to enter any optionable stock symbol (ex. aapl) and look up the option chains on that stock.
